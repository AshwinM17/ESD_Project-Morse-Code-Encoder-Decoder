# Introduction
Morse code, a method of encoding text characters as sequences of dots and dashes, has been
historically used in telecommunications. This project seeks to modernize the use of Morse
code by implementing a system capable of encoding and decoding it in real-time. Using an
LPC1768 microcontroller efficiently handles user input and display output. The system offers
a hands-on demonstration of basic microcontroller principles and peripheral interfacing.

We implemented the project using a buzzer, LEDs, Matrix Keyboard, Timers, and LCD Display.

All further details can be found inside the pdf, which is also included.
